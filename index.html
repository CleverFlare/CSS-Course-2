    <p>
      We use HTML a lot, though some people might don't pay close attention to
      the mistakes they make in HTML, especially, beginner HTML coders, so let's
      today list these mistakes so that you notice and correct them next time
    </p>
    <h2>not indenting the code</h2>
    <p>
      Not indenting the code is a huge mistake! it makes reading the code for
      future you or your teammate/co-worker a nightmare, indentation simply
      means to leave a tab space in their place, and it's used when nesting too
      many blocks together, and in our HTML case, when nesting HTML tags
      together
    </p>
    <h2>not knowing where to put the closing tag</h2>
    <p>
      This mistake could denote that you essentially don't know what you're
      doing, but for many people, it's just an unintentional mistake, and it
      happens when for example you open the head tag and then close it inside of
      the body tag, it's just as if you put someone's head in his stomach,
      please pay close attention to where you put your closing tag
    </p>
    <h2>opening an element without closing it</h2>
    <p>
      This mistake is known for being super hidden, that's because the browser
      usually would fix it for you, especially smart browsers like Google
      Chrome, however, it's still a mistake and it most certainly leads to an
      undesired outcome, you might've encountered one of these problems before
      where everything is as if it's an H1, it's bold and big, yeah, you guessed
      it! you have opened an H1 somewhere without closing it, to avoid it I
      highly advise you to utilize the code editor's help, such as intellisense
      and autocompletion
